 estate-agency
 
Stand-alone application, where you can easily manage different kinds of immovables ( buildings, apartments, houses, lands etc ). As a technology, I used Java and SQL.
The application allows two kinds of users: one administrator and multiple agents. The administrator can add, delete , modify and view closed contracts per agent. As an agent, you can add, delete, modify and view different apartments, houses, lands etc.

Note: it does not contains the database.
